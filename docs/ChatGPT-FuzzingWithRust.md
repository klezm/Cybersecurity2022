# ChatGPT - Fuzzing with Rust

## üîç Question

create a test for krill using cargo fuzz

### üé≤ ChatGPT

To create a test for Krill using Cargo Fuzz, you can follow these steps:

1.  Install Cargo Fuzz by running `cargo install cargo-fuzz`
2.  In the root directory of your Krill project, run `cargo fuzz init` to create a new fuzzing target.
3.  Create a new directory called `fuzz` in the root directory of your project.
4.  In the `fuzz` directory, create a new file called `fuzz_targets.rs`. This file will contain the fuzzing targets for your project.
5.  In the `fuzz_targets.rs` file, define a new function called `fuzz_target` that takes in a `&[u8]` as an argument. This function will be the entry point for the fuzzer.
6.  In the `fuzz_target` function, call the relevant functions from your Krill project using the input bytes as the argument.
7.  In the root directory of your project, run `cargo fuzz run fuzz_target` to start the fuzzing process.

It's worth noting that this is just an example and the exact steps for creating a fuzz test for Krill can vary based on the specific implementation of the project.

## üîç Question

which function of krill should I test using cargo fuzz?

### üé≤ ChatGPT

The specific function of Krill that you should test using Cargo Fuzz depends on the functionality that you want to test. Ideally, you would want to test the functions that are most likely to receive input from untrusted sources or the ones that are most critical to the security or correctness of your application.

For example, if Krill is a network protocol implementation, you may want to test the functions that parse incoming network packets or handle incoming connections. If Krill is a cryptography library, you may want to test the functions that handle key generation or encryption/decryption.

It's also important to note that it's not necessary to test all functions of Krill using Cargo Fuzz, you could select just the most critical ones or the ones that are more prone to bugs or vulnerabilities.

## üîç Question

which functions of Krill receive input from potentially untrustworthy sources?

### üé≤ ChatGPT

In general, functions that receive input from potentially untrustworthy sources are those that handle external data such as data coming from a network, file system, or user input.

In the case of Krill, since it is a RPKI certificate and CRL issuance system, it is likely to handle data from both internal and external sources, like :

* functions that handle incoming requests from clients,
* functions that process data from external sources such as the RPKI repository,
* functions that validate client's requests and data coming from other sources.

It's worth noting that the exact functions that receive input from potentially untrustworthy sources depend on the specific implementation of Krill. I would recommend checking the codebase and identifying the functions that handle input from external sources or that are critical to the security or correctness of your application.

### üé≤ ChatGPT

Here's an example of a fuzz test for the `TbsIdCert::from_constructed` function using Cargo Fuzz:

```rust
use cargo_fuzz::fuzz;
use rpki::TbsIdCert;

fuzz! {
    fn fuzz_tbs_id_cert_from_constructed(data: &[u8]) {
        let _ = TbsIdCert::from_constructed(&mut rpki::decode::Constructed::new(data));
    }
}
```

This test uses the `fuzz!` macro provided by Cargo Fuzz to define a fuzz target. The target function, `fuzz_tbs_id_cert_from_constructed`, takes in a `&[u8]` as input and calls the `TbsIdCert::from_constructed` function with the input bytes as an argument. By running `cargo fuzz run fuzz_tbs_id_cert_from_constructed`, the test will exercise the `TbsIdCert::from_constructed` function with various inputs generated by the fuzzer, which could help find any potential bugs or vulnerabilities in the function.

## üîç Question

the code does not work, please correct it.  
The struct TbsIdCert is in the file "rpki-rs/src/ca/idcert.rs".

### üé≤ ChatGPT

Here's the corrected version of the test:

```rust
use cargo_fuzz::fuzz;
use rpki_rs::ca::idcert::TbsIdCert;

fuzz! {
    fn fuzz_tbs_id_cert_from_constructed(data: &[u8]) {
        let _ = TbsIdCert::from_constructed(&mut rpki_rs::decode::Constructed::new(data));
    }
}
```

In this version, I've imported the correct struct and the correct path of the struct. You also need to make sure that the `rpki_rs` crate is properly added to your dependencies and that you have the correct version of the crate installed. Also, you need to run `cargo fuzz build` to build the fuzz target before you can run the fuzz test. You can then run the test with `cargo fuzz run fuzz_tbs_id_cert_from_constructed`

## üîç Question

This still gives me the error: "use of undeclared crate or module \`rpki_rs\`"

### üé≤ ChatGPT

The error "use of undeclared crate or module `rpki_rs`" indicates that the `rpki_rs` crate is not properly added to your dependencies. You should add the `rpki_rs` crate to your dependencies in the `Cargo.toml` file, like this:

tomlCopy code

```toml
[dependencies]
rpki_rs = "version"
```

You should replace "version" with the desired version of the `rpki_rs` crate.

Also, you might want to check the spelling of the module name and the case sensitivity, make sure the module name is matching the actual module name. And you can use `cargo update` to update the dependencies before running the test.

Once you've done this, you should be able to run the test without encountering the "use of undeclared crate or module `rpki_rs`" error.

## üîç Question

I dont think thats how this should be solved. when I use use \`rpki::TbsIdCert;\` I get the error: "no \`TbsIdCert\` in the root"

### üé≤ ChatGPT

You are correct, my apologies for the confusion. It seems that the struct `TbsIdCert` is not in the root of the `rpki` crate, but in a submodule.

You need to specify the correct path of the struct in your test, you can find the correct path by searching the source code of the `rpki` crate or by checking its documentation. In your case, since you mention that the struct is in the file "rpki-rs/src/ca/idcert.rs" you should use

```rust
use rpki_rs::ca::idcert::TbsIdCert;
```

instead.

Also, make sure the package is installed and properly imported in your project. You can use `cargo update` to update the dependencies before running the test

Once you've done this, you should be able to run the test without encountering the "no `TbsIdCert` in the root" error. Please let me know if you need further assistance.

## üîç Question

I thinok it should be "use rpki::ca::idcert::TbsIdCert;" but now i get the error: "could not find \`ca\` in \`rpki\`"

### üé≤ ChatGPT

I apologize for the confusion, you are correct, it should be "use rpki::ca::idcert::TbsIdCert;". The error "could not find `ca` in `rpki`" indicates that the `ca` module is not present in the `rpki` crate. It's possible that the organization of the `rpki` crate has changed or that the struct `TbsIdCert` has been moved or removed since the knowledge cutoff of my last response. You can try searching through the source code of the `rpki` crate or checking its documentation to find the correct location of the struct. You can also try reaching out to the maintainers of the `rpki` crate to ask for help on finding the correct location of the struct. Please let me know if you need further assistance.

## üîç Question

how do i import a submodule from the parent directory in rust

### üé≤ ChatGPT

In Rust, you can import a submodule from the parent directory by specifying the path to the submodule after the parent module. The general syntax is `use parent_module::submodule::struct_or_function;`.

For example, if you have a file structure like this:

```css
my_project
|--src
   |--main.rs
   |--module1
      |--submodule1.rs
```

You can import the `submodule1` from the `module1` in the `main.rs` file like this:

```rust
use module1::submodule1;
```

If you want to import a struct or function from the submodule, you should specify the struct or function after the submodule in the path, like this:

```rust
use module1::submodule1::MyStruct;
use module1::submodule1::my_function;
```

It's also worth mentioning that if the submodule is in the parent directory of the current file you could use `super` keyword before the module name. For example, if you have a file structure like this:

```css
my_project
|--src
   |--module1
      |--submodule1.rs
      |--submodule2.rs
```

You can import the `submodule1` from the `submodule2.rs` file like this:

```rust
use super::submodule1;
```

Also, make sure that the modules and submodules are properly defined in the `mod.rs` file or in the root of your project. It's also important to mention that if the submodule is private you will not be able to import it from outside the parent module. Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there is anything else I can do to help.

## üîç Question

In my rust project i have the file fuzz\_target\_1.rs which is in the path fuzz/fuzz\_targets and not in the src directory. Now i want to import a submodule from my rust project in the src folder in my fuzz\_target_1.rs. How do i do that?

### üé≤ ChatGPT

If you want to import a submodule from your Rust project in the `src` folder in your `fuzz/fuzz_targets/fuzz_target_1.rs` file, you can use the `use` keyword and specify the path to the submodule relative to the root of your project.

For example, let's say you have a file structure like this:

```css
my_project
|--src
   |--main.rs
   |--module1
      |--submodule1.rs
|--fuzz
   |--fuzz_targets
      |--fuzz_target_1.rs
```

In this case, you can import the `submodule1` from the `module1` in the `fuzz_target_1.rs` file like this:

```rust
use crate::src::module1::submodule1;
```

You can also use `super::` keyword to go up the directory tree. The `super::` keyword can be used multiple times to go up multiple levels.

```rust
use super::super::src::module1::submodule1;
```

It's also worth noting that if the submodule is private, you won't be able to import it from outside the parent module.

Please note that the path to the submodule may be different depending on your specific project structure. Make sure that the path you are using is correct and the modules and submodules are properly defined in the `mod.rs` file or in the root of your project. Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to help.

## üîç Question

I wrote a test but it is not working. can you fix it? 

```rust
#![no_main]
use libfuzzer_sys::fuzz_target;

mod rpki {
    pub mod ca {
        pub mod idcert {}
    }
}

fuzz_target!(|data: &[u8]| {
    let _ = idcert::TbsIdCert::from_constructed(&data);
});
```

### üé≤ ChatGPT

The test you've provided is not working because the `idcert` module is not in scope. You need to specify the path to the `idcert` module in the `use` statement. Here's the corrected version of your test:

```rust
#![no_main]
use libfuzzer_sys::fuzz_target;

mod rpki {
    pub mod ca {
        pub mod idcert {}
    }
}

use rpki::ca::idcert;

fuzz_target!(|data: &[u8]| {
    let _ = idcert::TbsIdCert::from_constructed(&data);
});
```

In this version, the `idcert` module is imported with the `use` statement, so it's in scope and can be used in the fuzz target function.

It's also worth noting that you should use `rpki_rs::ca::idcert` instead of `rpki::ca::idcert` as it is the name of the package you are using.

Also, make sure you have the correct version of the package installed and that it is properly imported in your project. You can use `cargo update` to update the dependencies before running the test. Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there is anything else I can do to help.
